# Changelog

All notable changes to SyncMill are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Migration artifacts now bind apply, verify, and rollback to the planned
  physical destination store. A changed path, endpoint, collection, or history
  database fails closed before opening the destination or changing the ledger.
- Legacy schema-v1 migration artifacts without a destination binding are no
  longer adopted from the current working-directory configuration. Unapplied
  artifacts must be replanned; already-applied artifacts require manual recovery
  from `state.json` target IDs using the original destination settings.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-07-12

First formal GitHub release, closing the pluggable memory-backend roadmap.

### Added

- Staged, source-retaining memory migration with `plan`, `apply`, `verify`, and
  guarded `rollback` commands.
- Bidirectional migration among memtomem, Mem0, and persistent LangGraph
  `AsyncSqliteStore` backends.
- Optional `syncmill[langgraph]` backend using local multilingual FastEmbed and
  SQLite persistence without LLM calls.
- Persistent work board, bilingual dashboard and user guides, named team
  profiles, read-only MCP gateway, run envelopes, quality gates, circuit
  breaker, live monitoring, and durable interactive sessions.

### Changed

- Mem0 is hardened for verbatim storage, exact Qdrant lifecycle operations,
  reliable teardown, explicit local-lock guidance, and first-import telemetry
  semantics.
- Memory status output uses backend-specific safe-field allowlists.
- Migration reconciliation is resumable and linear-time, with immutable
  digests, source-drift checks, empty-target gates, and exact verification
  receipts.

### Operations

- Migration snapshots contain plaintext memory and are retained until manually
  removed; protect `~/.syncmill/migrations/` accordingly.
- Changes to Mem0, LangGraph, or migration SDK boundaries require their opt-in
  real integration smokes before release.
